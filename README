The logic of the authorization  is (in methods)

•	/register  (email + passwd)  without token. Creating user in DB, sending email with verification code

•	/activate (email + passwd + verificationCode from email) without token. Activating user in DB

*	The tockens for access and update are in the .env (JWT_SECRET and REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET) and also the REFRESH_TOKEN_LIFE    

•	/login (email + passwd) without token. Creating 2 tokens: authToken & refreshToken. (temprorary return of both of them)

•	/logout (email + passwd) without token. Clear tokens in DB

•	/refresh (email + passwd + refresh token) and return auth token (refresh).

• ...

•	Everything else answered only if token come (req.body.token || req.query.token || req.headers.token)
